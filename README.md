## Information

#### About
GameSense is a Minecraft Forge "Utility Mod" for anarchy-related servers such as 2b2t. 
This project was started by Cyber and Hoosiers in early January 2020 as a method to learn some basics of Java coding.
Feel free to contribute and join the official discord by clicking the shield above.
Please note, this repository and mod is not associated with "GameSense.pub" nor does it use any assets/code from it.

Most notable features:
* Custom combat modules
* Viewmodel changer
* Custom renderings that are compatible with other mods such as future
* Clean GUI and stable config
* Unique HUD components that are comparable to ones seen in paid clients.

#### Credits
***Check specific class files for full credits.***
This client started out based off of FINZ0's Osiris, which in turn was based off of 086's KAMI. 
Without these projects, GameSense would not exist so a lot of credit is due to them for their work.

This client also implements the ClickGUI using PanelStudio: https://github.com/lukflug/PanelStudio/.
If you believe that we are using your code and credits are not properly given, please message GooberTown#7384 on Discord.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation
1. GameSense requires Minecraft v1.12.2 Forge to run. You can download that here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/.
2. Once forge is installed, download the latest release from the releases page or from the discord.
3. Navigate to your Minecraft folder (%appdata%/.minecraft).
4. If this does not already exist, create a folder titled `mods` and with another folder inside titled `1.12.2`.
5. Drag the release jar into the `1.12.2` folder.
6. Launch the game using your Forge profile (created in step 1).

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing
Feel free to help out with development by creating a pull request and it will be reviewed.

#### Guidelines
* All code commited should be original or properly credited.
* Please explain `in detail` on what you changed and why it would be beneficial.
* Try to separate new features. Large pull requests with multiple new features take longer to be merged.
* Try to follow the general style of the project.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask in the discord or by messaging Hoosiers (GooberTown#7384) on Discord.
